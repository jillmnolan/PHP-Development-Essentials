# Web Development Essentials, a Visual Studio Code extension package.

## Background

Are you tired of reinstalling extensions on each of your computer(s)?  How about when you have to reset computer entirely?  Or, how about you're an instructor, a hobbyist, or just "getting your feet wet" in the fine craft of web development who does not know which extension(s) to select to get the job done both **efficiently** and **effectively**.  Regardless, please do not waste time and energy on something so tedious as a process of installing extensions.  Extensions are, in a word, awesome!  Their premise is to extend the features and functionality of Visual Studio Code.

## What extensions will I get by selecting this extension package?

Glad, that you've asked!  Please find the supervening extensions and subsequent "themes" as well.  Of course, I always love to hear your suggestions to improve this extension package.
